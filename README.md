# ChatGPT Telegram Bot

This Python script allows you to create a Telegram bot that interacts with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to provide text-based conversational responses to users.

## Prerequisites

To use this script, you will need:

- A Telegram bot API token. You can get one by talking to [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather).
- An API key for OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. You can sign up for access to the API at [https://beta.openai.com/signup/](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
- git clone https://github.com/Yershat/chatgpt-telegram-bot.git

2. Install the required packages by running the following command in the project directory:
- pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set the `TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN` and `CHATGPT_API_KEY` variables in the `chatgpt_telegram_bot.py` script to your Telegram bot API token and OpenAI GPT-3 API key, respectively.


4. Run the script by running the following command in the project directory:
- python chatgpt_telegram_bot.py


## Usage
Once the script is running, users can interact with the bot by sending messages to it. The bot will respond with text-based conversational responses generated by OpenAI's GPT-3 language model.

The bot also includes a "premium" feature that allows users to ask specific questions to the GPT-3 model. To use this feature, users must first register as a premium user by sending the `/ask` command to the bot. Premium users can then ask the bot specific questions by sending a message containing their question.
